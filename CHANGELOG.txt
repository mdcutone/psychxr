This file contains changes introduced to PsychXR for each version. Breaking
changes may be incompatible with your current code.

Version 0.2.0 - 2019/04/02
--------------------------

New Features:

    - Added LibOVRPose, LibOVRPoseState, LibOVRSessionStatus, LibOVRHmdInfo, etc.
    - Library now exposes vectors, quaternions, and matrices as Numpy arrays.
    - LibOVR version bump to 1.32.
    - Functions which call the LibOVR API return error/success codes, making it
    easier to write custom error handlers.
    - More arguments for 'ovr.initialize()', such as 'focusAware'.
    - LibOVRPose handles rigid body pose data like 'ovr.math.Posef' did.
    - Added swap chain names 'LIBOVR_TEXTURE_SWAP_CHAIN*'.
    - Added 'setControllerVibration' for haptic feedback.

Bug Fixes:

    - Cleaned up old and unused code from 'psychxr.ovr'.
    - Lots of misc. bug fixes.

Breaking Changes:

    - Many API functions have been removed or renamed, some functions take
    different arguments all together.
    - Removed 'ovr.math' module, use LibOVRPose for rigid body transforms.
    - Removed 'ovr.capi', import 'psychxr.ovr' instead.
    - Reduced number of possible swap chains to 8 for now.
    - You must now manage getting the next available swap chain index.

Known Issues:

    - Calling 'shutdown' crashes on exit, only after making a swap chain. Not
    sure what the cause of this problem is, but it seems harmless.
    - Still restricted to a single swap chain.


Version 0.1.3 - 2018/07/04
--------------------------

New Features:

    - Added "getPitchYawRoll" method to ovrQuatf object.
    - Changed "ovrSessionStatus" getter functions to properties.

Bug Fixes:

    - No bug fixes this release.

Breaking:

    - "ovrSessionStatus" getter functions are now properties.
