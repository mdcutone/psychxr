**When can we expect OpenXR/OpenVR support?**

This is very often asked since there are many HMD platforms in use not supported
by `libovr`. The short answer is "soon" for OpenXR (Q4 2021 might see a preview
release). OpenVR is no longer being considered since OpenXR seems to be the
direction the industry is moving towards.
