# PsychXR

Python extension library for interacting with eXtended Reality displays (HMDs), intended for research in neuroscience and psychology.

Device API wrappers are written in Cython, providing low latency and overhead. Only OpenGL based applications on Windows PCs are currently supported. Additional support for other platforms (Mac OS and Linux) is contingent on support from the device manufacturer.

## Supported Devices

* Oculus Rift DK2 and CV1

## Getting Started

The easiest way to get PsychXR is to get the [*.whl package](https://github.com/mdcutone/psychxr/releases) and install it using the 'pip install' command. The pre-compiled binaries are built on Windows 10 64-bit using the MSVC 15.0 compiler against Python 3.6 64-bit.
